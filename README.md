## Welcome to My C++ Pricing Repository! üöÄ
Hello there! üëã

Thank you for visiting this repository, where I document my exploration of C++ through the implementation of pricing models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and the Black-Scholes framework. As I delve into the world of quantitative finance and computational methods, this repository serves as a space to share my progress, code, and insights.

## üìö About This Repository

This repository focuses on applying fundamental C++ programming concepts to solve real-world problems in financial engineering. The primary goal is to implement pricing methods for financial derivatives using PDEs and the Black-Scholes model. Alongside these advanced applications, you‚Äôll also find code that builds up the foundational skills necessary for these implementations.

Whether you‚Äôre learning C++, studying quantitative finance, or just curious about numerical methods, I hope you find value in this work. Feel free to explore, learn, and share your suggestions for improvement!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation Tips for macOS

If you're using the `clang++` compiler on macOS, here are a few important commands to help you get started:

To compile a C++ file (e.g, source_file.cpp) and generate an executable, use:
```bash
clang++ -o output_file_name source_file.cpp

```

Tu run the Compiled Program :

```bash
./output_file_name 

```

To format your code : 


```bash

clang-format -i src/TP2/Pointer_references_arrays.cpp
